# This manuscript fixes a specific problem that the ruby gems fails to install
# due to permission problems as described in
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31972968
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14607193
# ...and many more
#
# In short the problem is this:
# Ruby is preinstalled on Mac and sits in /usr/bin - which you don't have
# access to make changes to - so if you wanna make changes to Ruby install
# you should get your own Ruby; use brew to make that happen:
# installs:
#  -
#    module: homebrew
#    name:   ruby
#    state:  latest
#
# This installs Ruby in user/local/bin - where you want it.
#
# But on some versions of MacOs the /etc/paths file lists /usr/bin before
# /usr/local/bin - this is wrong!
#
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34984870/#
#
# ...And it means that your newly installed  Ruby never comes into play.
#
# This maunscript puts user/local/bin on top
#
#
# Run it like this
# ansible-playbook  macascode.yml  -bK --extra-vars "manuscript=manuscripts/fix_usr_local_bin.yml"

installs:
  - module: test
    parameters:
      path: /etc/paths
      state:  absent
      regexp: /usr/local/bin
    become: yes
  -
    module: test
    parameters:
      path:   /etc/paths
      state:  present
      regexp: /usr/local/bin
      insertafter: BOF
      line:   /usr/local/bin
    become: yes
